					<h2>Low Cost Telemontoring System for Mines</h2>
				  <p class="subDetails">2015-16 (Masters Project)</p>
                    <p>This was Masters thesis project; in the value chain of  IoT, this project was focused mostly on the development  of sensors frontend, a low-cost localised networking solution of those sensors.  The solution proposed in this work addressed issues like easy serviceability of this system by keeping  development environment of the proposed prototype the Arduino IDE. As Arduino  programming environment is much easy to  learn and expertise, this work claimed that the proposed openware technology in the thesis work could diffuse much faster in the industrial sectors of Indian and other  developing country much more rapidly than  its currently existing counterparts.</p>

					<h2>SAR Interferometry</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2014 (B.Tech Project)</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Study on Applicability of  Remote Sensing in Detection of the Ground Deformation&rdquo;: this project started  with reviewing several case studies, and technical articles were reviewed, to  cite a comparison between conventional methods of ground deformation monitoring,  and with &lsquo;Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry&rsquo; (InSAR). This project dealt  with the basics of the RADAR operation, data storage and file handling of radar  data. Data processing and data interpretation algorithms for radar imaging.  Finally, an attempt was made to do a simulation for &lsquo;Side Looking Aperture  Radar&rsquo; (SLAR) which shall be capable of demonstrating both Real Aperture Radar  (RAR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data accusation procedures. However,  at that point of time only first prototype of the program was presented that  compromised many desired properties in programs generated &lsquo;Single Look  Component&rsquo; (SLC) Images.</p>

					<h2>Study of Future Trends  <br> in
Mining Industry</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2015 (4th Year Summer Project)</p>
					<p>Under the expert guidance of Prof. A.K.Ghose (Ex. Director, ISM Dhanbad) I had the opportunity to do this research internship, financially supported with a stipend from INAE.
                    Firstly, taking account of the ‘Resource Scarcity’ issue, various non-conventional mineral and energy resources were studied and challenges in their implementation were discussed. And this study discussed the challenges and technical limitation of green energy solutions & efficient energy use agenda; thus importance of taking the venture of getting access to new resources was mainly discussed in the report. Next, study on the current state of the art technology for ‘Surface Mine Slope Stability Monitoring & Alarming System’ was taken. Along with the study of ‘Applicability of Introducing Real-Time Monitoring of Mining Process Parameter within ERP System for enhancing Safety & Productivity’.</p>

					<h2>Hyper-Spectral Satellite Remote Sensing for Mineral Identification</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2013 (3rd Yr. Summer Project)</p>
					<p>The primary aim of this project was to code programs for a  computational tool which shall be capable of demonstrating data processing for  Hyper-Spectral image data. Whereas in the case of software, it just does the  processing, that is often like a black-box to an operator. Thus, the purpose of  this project was to build a framework that gives operator flexibility of  manually see and tweak the data at each step of the process; and also enables  the user to insert some of his/her designed algorithms in between, for the sake  of experimentation and research. Implementations of these analysis were  comprised of technique like PCA, n-D Clustering, VCA including other  multivariate statistical analysis, data visualisation techniques, data  interpretation etcetera.</p>
